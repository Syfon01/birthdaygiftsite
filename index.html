    <div class="giftsection"> 
        <h2 class="gift-title">Here's how happy I am for you today 🥳</h2>
        <h3 class="gift-notes">(Hover over the gift)</h3> 
        <div class="gift-image" id="gift-image-happy"></div> 
        <h3>I'm so happy God has kept you healthy, sane, and sound to this day. I'm thankful to God for all He
            <br>is doing in your life. This will be your best year, yet. It might be a crazy season, but I tell you, God's got you.

     <div class="giftsection">
        <h2 class="gift-title">Here's how people react when you enter a room😍</h2> 
        <div class="gift-image" id="gift-image-hot"></div> 
        <h3>You are unarguably a very beautiful woman. Not beauty in the eyes of the beholder kind of beauty, LMAO,<br>
             but beauty that everyone can behold. You are excellent in all you do. I have lived with you for years,<br>
            and I can say with my semi-full chest(inserts crazy laughter) that you are super caring and that inspires me.
        <br> Basa, you are a solid human and a pure delight. You are EVERYTHING GOOD</h3>  
    </div>


    <div class="giftsection">
        <h2 class="gift-title">If I had to describe you with ONE word 👇</h2>
        <div class="gift-image" id="gift-image-genius"></div>  
        <h3>You know, I intentionally used genius, because that's exactly who you are. Please don't doubt me. 
            <br>You know, I read a quote by Robin Sharma that said, "All of the great geniuses of the world were inspired
            <br> and driven by their desire to enrich the lives of others." and I was like dang! You see now that you are one?
            <br> You've enriched my life, your family and many others. Please take your 'genius' flowers. 
        </h3>
    </div> 


    <div class="giftsection">
        <h2 class="gift-title">The only person as badass as you 💪</h2>
        <div class="gift-image" id="gift-image-badass"></div>
        <h3>I tried thinking of someone that I could compare to you, and I found none. Then, I realize you're the only one <br>
        as badass as YOU. The way you love, the way you shoulder your responsibilities, and that of others? <br>
        No one does it better than you. Your badassery is UNMATCHED!</h3> 
    </div> 

    <div class="giftsection">
        <h2 class="gift-title">While raising a 🥂 for how amazing you are, I want to say a resounding...</h2>
        <div class="gift-image" id="gift-image-thanks"></div>
        <h3>A million "thank you" will never be enough to express how grateful I am for you, who you are, and all you do.
            <br>As per the wordsmith that I am🤣, I have many wonderful words to tell you, but none can do justice. 
            <br>You are one of the greatest gifts my heart will ever know. You are one of the people I feel safe with.
            <br>Even when I'm not close by, I want you to know I love and appreciate you, always❤. 
            <br>Wrap yourself in this and consider it a big hug from me. Happy birthday QUEEN MOTHER👸🏽
            <br>This new year, God will come through for you in ways you can't fathom. God's got you and your family forever.
